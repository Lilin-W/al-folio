## Research Overview

This work represents a significant advancement in applying multimodal AI techniques to healthcare challenges, specifically focusing on lung cancer survival prediction. The research addresses a critical need in personalized medicine by developing more accurate predictive models that can assist clinicians in treatment planning.

### Key Contributions

- **Novel Architecture**: Developed the Attention-based Multimodal Bilinear Feature Fusion (AMBF) model that effectively integrates diverse data modalities
- **Data Integration**: Successfully combined CT imaging, PET imaging, and clinical data from the NSCLC Radiogenomics dataset
- **Performance**: Achieved exceptional results with MAE of 0.1341 and C-index of 0.8325 using our AMBF-SA approach

### Technical Innovation

The AMBF model introduces a sophisticated attention mechanism that addresses the inherent challenges in multimodal medical data:

1. **Data Heterogeneity**: Different data types (imaging, clinical) have varying scales and distributions
2. **Noise Handling**: Medical datasets often contain noisy or incomplete information  
3. **Feature Fusion**: Optimal integration of radiomic features with clinical parameters

This research demonstrates the potential of advanced AI techniques to improve clinical decision-making and patient outcomes in oncology.
