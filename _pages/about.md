I am a Master of Electrical Engineering student at the University of Pennsylvania, with a strong background in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. My research interests lie in the intersection of multimodal AI, machine learning applications in healthcare, and large language models.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Data Science and Big Data Technology at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University with First Class Honors (GPA: 3.76/4.0), where I was recognized with academic awards for being in the top 5% and 10% of my class.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on:
- **Multimodal AI**: Developing attention-based fusion models for integrating diverse data types (medical imaging, clinical data)
- **Healthcare AI**: Applying machine learning to medical data analysis, particularly in survival prediction and disease diagnosis
- **Natural Language Processing**: Working with large language models for multilingual applications and content moderation
- **Computer Vision**: Leveraging deep learning for real-time surveillance and object detection systems

## Recent Work

I have contributed to several research projects resulting in peer-reviewed publications in prestigious venues including IEEE conferences and ACL. My work spans from developing novel deep learning architectures for lung cancer survival analysis to evaluating LLMs for multilingual offensive language detection.

In addition to my research, I have gained valuable industry experience through internships at leading companies including ByteDance and Deloitte, where I applied data science and machine learning techniques to solve real-world business problems.
